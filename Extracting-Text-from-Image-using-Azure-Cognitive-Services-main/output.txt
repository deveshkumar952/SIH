Q1. list the elements of each of the following sets 
(i) A ={x EN/3<3<g) 
A = {4, 5, 6,7,8 } 
(ii) B= {xEN/ x is even, Uc 115 
B= {2, 4, 6,8,10} 
(1) C= {MEN/4th =3} 
x =- 1 
C= { 1} empty set 
Q2. let A = {2, 3, 9,5] 
(i) Show that A is nota subset of B = {n FN/ nes even) 
we need to find an element in A that is not inB 
In Set A. 235 € A 
but, {3} &B 
--. 
A is not a subset of B 
(ii) show that A is proper subject of C={1, 2,3, 8,9). 
we need to show that A is a subset of c but A is not equal to c 
Since allelements of A are also present inc 
{ 2 , 3, 4, 5 ] E C 
but also c has additional element 
21,6,7,98] E A 
A is proper set of C
